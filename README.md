Lop IP Remover is a simple Fabric mod for Minecraft which stop a player's public IP address from being logged by a server when they join it. This in turn prevents access to the player's public IP address which stops issues such as DDOSing, Doxxing and more from happening to said player.

**NOTE**: Lop IP Remover is a mod which **ONLY** works on dedicated servers. It will have no effect on the integrated server built into the Minecraft client.

## ðŸ”½ Installation

To install the mod, you will need the latest version of the Fabric Loader or new version newer than 0.14.18 installed. If you haven't installed Fabric already, you can find many guides on how to do so on YouTube or following the official guide [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

Once you have installed Fabric, you then simply just install the mod as you would any other mod onto your server.
